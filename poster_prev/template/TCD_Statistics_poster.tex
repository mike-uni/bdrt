	Phase-type (PHT) distributions are a natural choice for modelling the multiple phases
	of failure and repair which a redundant subsystem may go through before ultimately becoming
	unavailable.
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	\citeasnoun{bladt2001} present a scheme for Bayesian inference on general PHT distributions.
	There are some key areas where there is scope to extend this work in a reliability context:
	\begin{enumerate}[i)]
		\item the need to account for censoring and other common situations in reliability;
		\item the need for parameter constraints;
		\item the sampling scheme is intractably slow for the PHT distributions commonly encountered in reliability.

	Consider a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) with an absorbing state.  Without loss of generality, let the CTMC generator be written:
		\[ \mathbf{T} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{S} & \mathbf{s} \\\mathbf{0}^\mathrm{T} & 0\end{array}\right) \]
		Then, if $X$ is the random variable denoting time to entering the absorbing state:
		\[ \begin{array}{rcl}
			F_X(x) &=& 1 - \boldsymbol{\pi}^\mathrm{T} \exp\{x \mathbf{S}\} \mathbf{e}, \ \ \mathbf{e}=(1, \dots, 1)^\mathrm{T}\\
			f_X(x) &=& \boldsymbol{\pi}^\mathrm{T} \exp\{x \mathbf{S}\} \mathbf{s}
		\end{array} \]

%		The most significant advance to the algorithm of \citeasnoun{bladt2001} relates to the tractability of the MH sampling in the context of reliability theory.
				
		%\vspace{0.5em}
		The most significant advance is computational.  Consider the simple example presented in box 2 (with $\lambda_\mathrm{r} \approx 30^{-1}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{f} \approx 100000^{-1}$, say).
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Even small moves on the Gibbs step can result in samples of $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ such that observations $y_i$ are so extreme in the right PHT tail as to stall the rejection sampling;
			\item Furthermore, with $T_{14}=0$ there are significant issues with `invalid' MH proposals: when truncating to time $y_i$, if the CTMC is in state 1 an invalid absorbing move $1 \to 4$ is inserted.%  In this highly reliable subsystem, state 1 is the most common state so invalid proposals are rampant.
		\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Truncation}\end{center}
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\vspace{-0.5em}
		We propose two advances to remedy this.
		
		\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{a) Direct Conditional Sampling:} Rather than rejection sampling, which is susceptible to stalling, it is more desirable to sample $p(\mathrm{path\ \cdot} \,|\, \boldsymbol{\pi}, \mathbf{S}, Y \ge y_i)$ directly.  This requires the ability to sample from the conditional sojourn time density:
		\vspace{-0.5em}
		\[ p(\delta = \Delta \,|\, \boldsymbol{\pi}, \mathbf{S}, j(t), t, Y_i \ge y_i) \]
		
		\vspace{-0.5em}
		where $t$ is the current time and $j(t)$ the current state in the CTMC path being sampled.
		
		% \vspace{0.5em}
%		We have shown this can be calculated as:
%		\vspace{0.5em}
		\columnbreak
		
		This is nearly log-linear, though not log-concave.  Adaptive Rejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) has proven highly efficient.
		
		\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{b) Reverse Simulation:} For highly reliable systems, the starting state (full operation) is the most common.  Thus, by sampling in reverse from $y_i$ and truncating at 0 the commonality of state 1 becomes a major advantage and `invalid' proposals are rare.
		%\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Truncation}\end{center}
		
		\vspace{0.5em}
		This requires detailed balance to be satisfied.  Also, absorbing CTMCs don't necessarily reach stationarity, so selection of starting state must be made from the quasi-stationary distribution.
		
	\vspace{0.5em}
		\textbf{Speed Comparison:}
		
		\vspace{-1em}
