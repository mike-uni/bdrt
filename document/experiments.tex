\section{Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
\item A simple simulation to show the basic properties of the model.
\item A physical problem of some complexity that can be modelled and that can be estimated using this method. This is will be used to show where the model can solve problems that other existing methods may fail/struggle in and online setting. It may also reveal weaknesses in the model
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Example}
\begin{itemize}
\item The stimulus-response model in the neuroscience setting where we can use this method as an online image filter or in direct comparison to XGboost.
