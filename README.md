# bdrt
The main file is drt_main.cpp. Currently the header files are exact copies of the source files. This will change soon (ish).
To experiment with the programme, download and run ./drt on a linux based platform (compiled with g++). The instructions should be clear (well at least to me they are :) ). This is very much a hack-and-bash first attempt at my own c++ code any advice, comments and ideas are appreciated.
